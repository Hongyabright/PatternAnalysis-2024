# 3D U-Net for Prostate MRI Segmentation
###### YA HONG s4764092
This project uses **UNet-3D** to train the Prostate 3D dataset for medical volumetric image segmentation, evaluated by the **Dice similarity coefficient**. The dataset has significant **class imbalance** (e.g., background: 1,068,883,043 pixels, prostate: 1,771,500 pixels). The prostate is difficult to segment accurately due to its small volume, blurred boundaries, and the complexity of anatomical structures. To address these challenges, I applied data augmentation strategies, adjusted the modelâ€™s initial feature size (`init_features`), and experimented with various loss functions (such as **Dice loss**, weighted cross-entropy, and their combinations) to improve segmentation performance for minority classes.
